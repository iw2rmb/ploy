# Environment Variables

**Note: Postgres/mTLS Pivot (November 2025)**

As of the server/node pivot described in `README.md`, the following legacy systems have been removed:
- **etcd**: All `PLOY_ETCD_*` variables are no longer consumed by the codebase.
- **Token-based auth**: Bearer tokens replaced with mTLS-only authentication.
- **Node labels**: Removed in favor of resource-snapshot scheduling.

This document tracks the environment variables that the server, node, and CLI
use after the pivot. Update this file whenever a new variable is introduced,
defaults change, or components adopt additional configuration.

## Dependencies

- [cmd/ploy/dependencies.go](../../cmd/ploy/dependencies.go) — runtime factories
  resolving control-plane endpoints via mTLS.

## CLI

- `PLOY_RUNTIME_ADAPTER` — Optional runtime adapter selector. Defaults to
  `local-step`. Other adapters (e.g., `k8s`, `nomad`) can plug in here; the CLI
  fails fast when an unknown adapter name is provided.
- `PLOY_ASTER_ENABLE` — Opt-in switch for the experimental Aster bundle
  integration. Current default: `unset` (Aster toggles stay disabled).
- `PLOY_CONTROL_PLANE_URL` — Optional override for the control-plane base URL when cached descriptors do not yet
  embed the endpoint (new workstation) or you need to target a secondary cluster explicitly. Descriptors discovered via
  `ploy server deploy` or `ploy node add` remain the default for CLI calls.
- `PLOY_BUILDGATE_IMAGE` — Optional unified override for the Docker image used by the
  Build Gate executor for any stack. When set, it takes precedence over language‑specific
  defaults. Commands still auto‑select by workspace (Maven vs Gradle).
- `PLOY_BUILDGATE_PROFILE` — Optional gate profile selector. Allowed explicit values:
  `java`, `java-maven`, `java-gradle`. When unset/unknown, auto-detects: pom.xml → maven,
  build.gradle(.kts) → gradle, else plain `java`.
- `PLOY_BUILDGATE_JAVA_IMAGE` — Deprecated legacy override for Maven projects. Defaults to
  `maven:3-eclipse-temurin-17` when neither `PLOY_BUILDGATE_IMAGE` nor this value is set.
- `PLOY_BUILDGATE_GRADLE_IMAGE` — Deprecated legacy override for Gradle projects. Defaults to
  `gradle:8.8-jdk17` when neither `PLOY_BUILDGATE_IMAGE` nor this value is set.
- `PLOY_CONFIG_HOME` — Optional override for the base directory where cluster descriptors
  are stored. When unset, the CLI falls back to `XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ploy` or `~/.config/ploy`.
  Priority: `PLOY_CONFIG_HOME` → `XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ploy` → `~/.config/ploy`.
- `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` — Standard XDG Base Directory specification variable. When set
  (and `PLOY_CONFIG_HOME` is not), the CLI uses `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ploy` for cluster
  descriptor storage. Falls back to `~/.config/ploy` when both are unset.

Local cluster descriptors (written under `~/.config/ploy/clusters/`) now embed TLS material used by the CLI for mTLS:
- `ca_path` — CA certificate used as root trust for the control-plane.
- `cert_path` — Client certificate presented by the CLI.
- `key_path` — Private key for the client certificate.
When these fields are present for the default cluster, the CLI enforces TLS 1.3 and uses mTLS for all control‑plane calls.

Role model (mTLS certificate OUs / CNs):

- `cli-admin` — administrative CLI role. Allowed to perform admin operations (e.g., PKI sign, server/node rollout) and all
  standard client operations. For authorization, `cli-admin` is treated as a superset of `control-plane`.
- `client` (alias: `control`, `control-plane`, `controlplane`) — standard CLI role. Allowed to run Mods workflows and use
  control-plane APIs that do not require administrative privileges. Not allowed to hit admin-only endpoints like PKI sign.
- `worker` (alias: `node`) — node agent role. Used by `ployd-node` only to post heartbeats, logs, events, and claim runs.

Certificates can express role either in Subject OU `Ploy role=<role>` or via the CN prefix `<role>:` (e.g., nodes use `node:<uuid>`).
The server’s authorizer recognizes both forms.
- `USER` — Standard Unix environment variable indicating the current user. The CLI
  reads this to populate the `Submitter` field when creating mod runs via `ploy mod run`.
- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` — Docker Hub namespace used by runner templates. Images resolve to
  `docker.io/$DOCKERHUB_USERNAME/<name>:latest`.
- `DOCKERHUB_PAT` — Docker Hub Personal Access Token used for non‑interactive `docker login`
  on worker nodes during bootstrap. If set on the node, bootstrap performs
  `echo "$DOCKERHUB_PAT" | docker login -u "$DOCKERHUB_USERNAME" --password-stdin`.
- `MODS_IMAGE_PREFIX` — Optional absolute image prefix (e.g., `docker.io/org` or `ghcr.io/org`).
  Takes effect only when `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` is unset.
- `PLOY_OPENAI_API_KEY` — Optional OpenAI API key propagated to Mods LLM lanes. When set on the control
  plane, the runner injects it into the `mods-llm` container as `OPENAI_API_KEY`. You can also set it on
  worker nodes via a systemd drop-in to make it available cluster-wide.
- `PLOYD_CONFIG_PATH` — When set, provides the default ployd configuration file
  location (default `/etc/ploy/ployd.yaml`). The ployd flag `--config` overrides this
  environment variable when explicitly provided.
- `PLOYD_NODE_ID` — Node identifier for the ployd daemon. Set during bootstrap to a sanitized
  version of the node name. Note: currently exported by bootstrap but not consumed at runtime;
  node identity is specified in the node YAML (`node_id`).
- `PLOYD_HOME_DIR` — Home directory for the ployd daemon. Exported by bootstrap as `/root` for
  systemd context; not currently read by the codebase.
- `PLOYD_CACHE_HOME` — Cache directory for working data. Defaults to `/var/cache/ploy` when set
  by bootstrap. Used at runtime by the node agent for ephemeral workspaces.
- `PLOYD_METRICS_LISTEN` — Exported by bootstrap as `127.0.0.1:9101` for early scripts; not
  read by `ployd` at runtime. Use the YAML key `metrics.listen` (default `:9100`).


## Worker Nodes

- `PLOY_CA_CERT_PEM` — Cluster CA certificate presented to the node for mTLS trust (PEM-encoded).
  Required for node→server and server→node mTLS connections.
- `PLOY_CA_KEY_PEM` — Cluster CA private key (PEM-encoded). Set during bootstrap on the
  control-plane node to enable the `/v1/pki/sign` endpoint for signing node CSRs. Should
  only be present on the control-plane server; worker nodes do not require this variable.
- `PLOY_SERVER_CERT_PEM` / `PLOY_SERVER_KEY_PEM` — The node's TLS certificate and key
  (CSR-signed by the control plane). Despite the name, bootstrap uses these variables
  for both server and node flows and writes to `/etc/ploy/pki/node.crt` and
  `/etc/ploy/pki/node.key` on worker nodes.
- `concurrency` (config YAML) — Maximum concurrent runs the node will execute. Set in the
  node YAML under `concurrency`; defaults to `1` if not set.
- `PLOY_LIFECYCLE_NET_IGNORE` — Optional comma-separated list of network interface patterns (supports `*` globs) that the node lifecycle collector skips when computing throughput metrics. Example: `lo,cni*,docker*`.
  TODO: lifecycle collector to read this in an upcoming slice.
  - Pin via systemd drop-in or in `ployd.yaml` under `environment:` e.g.:

    environment:
      PLOY_LIFECYCLE_NET_IGNORE: "docker*,veth*,br-*"

- ployd-node config path — The node agent reads its YAML config from
  `/etc/ploy/ployd-node.yaml` by default and accepts an override via the
  CLI flag `--config`. There is currently no environment variable override
  for this path. TODO: consider introducing `PLOYD_NODE_CONFIG_PATH` for
  parity with the server’s `PLOYD_CONFIG_PATH`.

## E2E Harness

- `ploy mod run` executes Mods against the Ploy control plane; no tenant variable is required.
- `PLOY_E2E_TICKET_PREFIX` — Optional ticket ID prefix for Mods E2E runs
  (default `e2e`).
- `PLOY_E2E_REPO_OVERRIDE` — Optional Git repository override used by the Mods
  E2E scenarios in place of the default Java sample repo.
- `PLOY_E2E_GITLAB_TOKEN` — Optional GitLab PAT so the E2E harness can clean up
  branches after creating merge requests.
- `PLOY_E2E_LIVE_SCENARIOS` — Optional comma-separated scenario IDs that the
  live Mods smoke test should execute (defaults to `simple-openrewrite`).

- `PLOY_GITLAB_PAT` — Optional GitLab Personal Access Token used by the Mods E2E
  walkthroughs and MR creation notes in `STATE.md`. TODO: server-side GitLab wiring pending.

 

## gapi

- No environment variables are active for gapi within this codebase; record
  future additions here once the API slices land.

## Control Plane

- `PLOY_CONTROL_PLANE_URL` — Optional control-plane base URL override used by
  the CLI and node bootstrap commands. When unset, the CLI derives the endpoint
  and CA bundle from the cached cluster descriptor created during
  `ploy server deploy`.

### Server (Control Plane)

- `http.listen` (config YAML) — Address the server listens on for HTTPS API/SSE. Default `:8443`.
  There is no environment variable; set this in `ployd.yaml` under `http.listen`.
- `metrics.listen` (config YAML) — Address for Prometheus metrics endpoint. Default `:9100`.
  There is no environment variable; set this in `ployd.yaml` under `metrics.listen`.
- `PLOY_SERVER_CLUSTER_ID` — Unique identifier for the cluster (set during `ploy server deploy`).
  Currently set by bootstrap but not yet persisted or loaded by the server runtime.
- `PLOY_SERVER_CERT_PEM` / `PLOY_SERVER_KEY_PEM` — PEM-encoded server TLS certificate and key
  used by the bootstrap script to write files at `/etc/ploy/pki/server.crt` and
  `/etc/ploy/pki/server.key` for the HTTPS API. At runtime the server reads file paths from
  config: `http.tls.cert`, `http.tls.key`, and `http.tls.client_ca`.

- `gitlab.domain` (config YAML) — GitLab base URL (e.g., `https://gitlab.com`). Optional.
- `gitlab.token` (config YAML) — Inline GitLab Personal Access Token. Optional; stored only in
  memory at runtime, not persisted back to disk.
- `gitlab.token_file` (config YAML) — Path to a file containing the PAT. Optional. When set and
  `gitlab.token` is not provided, the server reads the token from this file at startup.
  Requirements:
  - File permissions must not grant group/other access (≤ `0600`).
  - Empty/whitespace-only files are rejected.
  - Relative paths resolve relative to the config file location (e.g., `/etc/ploy/ployd.yaml`).
  - Absolute paths are accepted as-is. Symlink handling is platform-default (`os.Stat`).
  Precedence: `gitlab.token` (inline) wins over `gitlab.token_file` when both are set.

### PKI

- `PLOY_SERVER_CA_CERT` — PEM-encoded cluster CA certificate presented to nodes. Required for
  the `/v1/pki/sign` endpoint to return signed certificates.
- `PLOY_SERVER_CA_KEY` — PEM-encoded cluster CA private key used to sign node CSRs. Required
  alongside `PLOY_SERVER_CA_CERT` for `/v1/pki/sign`. When either value is missing (empty or
  whitespace-only), the server responds with `503 PKI not configured`.
  If values are set but invalid (malformed PEM), the server returns `500 Internal Server Error`
  and logs details; fix the stored CA materials.


## PostgreSQL

The control plane can use PostgreSQL via `pgx/v5` and `pgxpool`.

Precedence at server startup:
- `PLOY_POSTGRES_DSN` (preferred)
- `postgres.dsn` in the config file

- `PLOY_POSTGRES_DSN` — DSN the server reads at startup to open a PostgreSQL pool.
  Example: `postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/ploy?sslmode=disable`.
  When `ploy server deploy` runs without `--postgresql-dsn`, the bootstrap installs
  PostgreSQL on the VPS and derives a password‑based TCP DSN suitable for the
  root‑run `ployd` service, e.g.: `host=127.0.0.1 port=5432 user=ploy password=ploy dbname=ploy sslmode=disable`.
  The server no longer recognizes `PLOY_SERVER_PG_DSN`.
- `PLOY_TEST_PG_DSN` — Optional Postgres DSN used by integration tests (e.g., `tests/integration/*` and
  packages that hit a real database such as `internal/store`). When unset, such tests skip automatically.

`ployd` reads `PLOY_POSTGRES_DSN` at startup; when unset, it falls back to `postgres.dsn` in the config file. Placeholders like `${PLOY_POSTGRES_DSN}` in
the config file are treated as unset unless the environment variable is actually present.

## Bootstrap Script

These environment variables are used internally by the bootstrap script generated during
`ploy server deploy` and `ploy node add` flows. They are not required for day‑to‑day CLI
usage but are documented here for completeness.

- `PLOY_BOOTSTRAP_VERSION` — Version string exported at the top of generated bootstrap scripts
  (default: `dev` in source, overridden at build time).
- `PLOY_INSTALL_POSTGRESQL` — When `true`, the bootstrap script installs PostgreSQL on the
  target host and derives `PLOY_POSTGRES_DSN`; when `false`, the provided DSN is used as-is.
  Not exported as an environment variable; checked inline within the script body.
- `PLOY_DB_PASSWORD` — Ephemeral password generated during PostgreSQL install flows and used
  to create the `ploy` database role and DSN. Set only within the bootstrap script scope.
- `BOOTSTRAP_PRIMARY` — When `true`, the bootstrap script performs control‑plane specific actions
  (e.g., writing server certs instead of node certs). Passed as `--primary` flag and checked
  inline within the script.
- `NODE_ID` — Node identifier used in the node agent config. Passed as `--node-id` script
  argument and referenced in `/etc/ploy/ployd-node.yaml` generation.
- `CLUSTER_ID` — Cluster identifier passed as `--cluster-id` script argument. Currently used
  for labeling during provisioning; not yet persisted or consumed by server runtime.
- `NODE_ADDRESS` — IP/hostname of the node being provisioned, passed as `--node-address` script
  argument.
- `PLOY_SERVER_URL` — Control-plane base URL used by `ploy node add` bootstrap to populate
  `server_url` in `/etc/ploy/ployd-node.yaml` (e.g., `https://<server-host>:8443`).
  This variable is consumed only by the bootstrap script; the CLI separately exposes a
  `--server-url` flag and `PLOY_CONTROL_PLANE_URL` override for client operations.

Primary reuse behavior:
- On control‑plane (primary) hosts, when `/etc/ploy/pki/ca.key` already exists, the bootstrap
  script treats the host as an existing cluster and skips all PKI writes (CA cert/key and
  server cert/key). It logs a reuse message and proceeds to (re)write configs and systemd units
  only. This prevents accidental clobbering of an existing cluster PKI.

Alternatively, you can specify the DSN in the config file under `postgres.dsn`. Environment variables take
precedence over the config file when both are present.

## Legacy (Removed November 2025)

## Build Gate Limits

The Build Gate executor supports optional resource limits via environment variables on worker nodes:

- `PLOY_BUILDGATE_LIMIT_MEMORY_BYTES` — Memory limit for the gate container. Supports human suffixes
  such as `768MiB`, `1G`, or plain bytes. Parsed with Docker's units parser.
- `PLOY_BUILDGATE_LIMIT_DISK_SPACE` — Disk/quota limit for the gate container's writable layer. Supports
  human suffixes (e.g., `2G`). Passed to Docker as the storage option `size` (driver dependent; requires
  overlay2 with xfs project quotas or equivalent). When unsupported by the driver, container creation may fail.
- `PLOY_BUILDGATE_LIMIT_CPU_MILLIS` — CPU limit in millicores (e.g., `500` = 0.5 CPU, `1500` = 1.5 CPU).

Notes:
- When both `PLOY_BUILDGATE_IMAGE` and a language default apply, `PLOY_BUILDGATE_IMAGE` wins.
- Memory and disk limits accept human‑friendly suffixes; CPU uses numeric millicores only.
