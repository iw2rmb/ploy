# Golang Engineering Guide

This document codifies Go engineering rules for this repository. It complements `docs/GOLANG.md` (tooling quickstart) and aligns with our RED → GREEN → REFACTOR cadence from `AGENTS.md`.

- Primary references
  - docs: `docs/GOLANG.md` (tooling), `AGENTS.md` (TDD + coverage), `SIMPLE.md` (server/node pivot), `ROADMAP.md` (delivery steps)
  - externals (authoritative): Go Code Review Comments, Effective Go, fuzzing and security/govulncheck guidance, and the Uber Go Style Guide. See References.

## Versions & Layout
- Target Go: match repository requirement in `README.md` (Go 1.25+).
- Modules: single-module unless otherwise justified. Keep public APIs stable; prefer `internal/...` for non‑exported packages.
- Package boundaries: keep CLI thin; orchestration logic lives under `internal/...` packages per `AGENTS.md`.

## Formatting & Linting
- Run `gofmt -w` (or `gofumpt -w` if the repo standardizes on it), followed by `goimports -w` to group imports (stdlib, third‑party, local). Code must be mechanically formatted; no hand‑tuned style deviations.
- `go vet ./...` and `staticcheck ./...` on touched packages before submit. Integrate `golangci-lint` locally/CI for aggregate checks.
- Keep the working tree clean between tool runs; commit only after format/lint/test pass.

## Error Handling
- Don’t use panic for normal errors; prefer `error` returns. Error strings are lowercase without trailing punctuation; wrap with `%w` and use `errors.Is/As` for inspection.
- Avoid double-reporting (log and return). Return errors to the caller or log at the edge.

## Documentation & Naming
- Exported identifiers require doc comments that start with the identifier name and end with a period. Use mixedCaps; avoid ALL_CAPS.

## Context & Concurrency
- Accept `context.Context` as the first parameter when work is request‑scoped; propagate deadlines/cancellation. Do not store `Context` in structs.
- Make goroutine lifetimes explicit; avoid leaks. Prefer cancellation via context and `errgroup` patterns (or channel close rules). Be careful with `t.Parallel()` in table tests—capture loop vars correctly.

## Testing, Fuzzing, Coverage
- Unit tests are table‑driven with subtests (`t.Run`). Keep clear failure messages; follow RED → GREEN → REFACTOR.
- Fuzzing: add fuzz targets for critical parsing/decoding paths (`FuzzXxx(*testing.F)`); keep targets deterministic and fast.
- Always run with the race detector on touched packages: `go test -race ./pkg/...`.
- Coverage targets: ≥60% overall and ≥90% on critical workflow runner packages (per `AGENTS.md`).

## Security & Supply Chain
- Scan dependencies with `govulncheck ./...` as part of release and when changing dependencies. Prefer fixes that upgrade vulnerable modules.
- Prefer standard library first; add third‑party deps only with rationale. Keep `go.mod` minimal; run `go mod tidy -v`.

## Logging & Observability
- Prefer structured logging (e.g., `log/slog`) with stable keys; never log secrets.
- Expose metrics (Prometheus) and enable pprof endpoints for long‑running services.

## HTTP/Networking
- For servers, set timeouts: `ReadHeaderTimeout`, `ReadTimeout`, `WriteTimeout`, `IdleTimeout`. Always close response bodies; use `http.Client{Timeout: ...}` and per‑request contexts.

## Database (PostgreSQL) — pgx + sqlc
- Use `pgx/v5` with `pgxpool` and typed `sqlc` queries as the default data layer (schema in `SIMPLE.sql`).
- Transactions: check errors on `Commit`; rollback on error with `defer tx.Rollback(ctx)`.
- Contexts: every query accepts a `ctx` with deadlines where appropriate.
- Migrations in `internal/store/migrations/`; queries in `internal/store/queries/`; generate code via `sqlc` and commit generated artifacts only if our CI does not run generators.

## Performance Tips
- Avoid unnecessary allocations; preallocate slices where size is known. Avoid `defer` in hot loops. Reuse buffers where safe. Measure with benchmarks and pprof before optimizing.

## CLI & Build Rules
- Use `make build` to compile, `make test` to run `go test -cover ./...` along with guardrails (see `AGENTS.md`). Keep the CLI binary minimal.

## Code Review Expectations
- Reviews enforce this guide and Go’s Code Review Comments. Prefer small, focused PRs with tests; table‑driven tests and race detector required on changed packages. Cite relevant rule in feedback.

## Tooling Quick Commands (baseline)
- Format/imports: `gofmt -w . && goimports -w .`
- Vet/lint: `go vet ./... && staticcheck ./...` (or `golangci-lint run`)
- Tests: `go test ./...` (add `-race`, `-cover` as needed)
- Fuzz: `go test -fuzz=Fuzz -run=^$ ./...`
- Vulns: `govulncheck ./...`
- Mods: `go mod tidy -v`
