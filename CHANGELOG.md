# Changelog

## [2025-09-26] Lane Engine & Describe CLI
- Added `internal/workflow/lanes` with TOML loader, cache-key composer, validation, and unit tests covering required fields and deterministic outputs.
- Introduced `configs/lanes/node-wasm.toml` and `configs/lanes/go-native.toml` as the first Grid-ready lane profiles.
- Extended `cmd/ploy` with `lanes describe`, golden-style CLI tests, and richer top-level usage guidance.
- Propagated lane metadata through the workflow runner and in-memory Grid stub; stages now error when lane assignments are missing.
- Documented the lane system in `README.md`, `cmd/ploy/README.md`, `docs/LANES.md`, and marked roadmap slice `03-lane-engine` complete.

## [2025-09-26] Workflow Runner CLI Stub
- Expanded `internal/workflow/runner` with a default DAG planner, stage execution loop, retry handling, temporary workspace management, and error propagation for Grid interactions.
- Added an in-memory Grid client, stage invocation tracking, and extensive unit tests lifting runner package coverage to 94.5%.
- Updated `cmd/ploy` to support `--ticket auto`, inject JetStream/Grid stubs via testable factories, and emit usage/help output across new error paths.
- Extended CLI tests to cover command dispatch, usage printers, and runner wiring; repository-wide `go test -cover ./...` now satisfies ≥60% overall coverage.
- Documented environment placeholders (`JETSTREAM_URL`, `GRID_ENDPOINT`, `IPFS_GATEWAY`) and new behaviour in `cmd/ploy/README.md`; marked roadmap slice `02-workflow-runner-cli` complete.

## [2025-09-25] Event Contract Stub
- Added `internal/workflow/contracts` with schema version `2025-09-25`, subject helpers, and validation logic for workflow tickets and checkpoints.
- Wired `internal/workflow/runner` to claim tickets, validate payloads, and publish an initial `claimed` checkpoint through a JetStream stub.
- Updated the CLI to require `--tenant`, bootstrap the in-memory bus, and reflect the new behaviour in usage docs.
- Documented the subject map and example payloads in `docs/design/shift/event-contracts.md`; roadmap slice `01-event-contracts` now marked complete.

## [2025-09-25] Legacy Teardown
- Removed all legacy API, Nomad, Consul, SeaweedFS, and deployment scaffolding.
- Replaced the repo with a CLI-only stub (`ploy workflow run`) that validates ticket input and returns `ErrNotImplemented`.
- Added guardrail tests that fail if legacy binaries or imports reappear.
- Simplified the build system (`Makefile`) to focus on the workflow CLI.
- Rewrote documentation (`README.md`, `docs/DOCS.md`, `cmd/ploy/README.md`) to describe the Shift architecture and roadmap alignment.
